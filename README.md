# Implementation of Support Vector Machine for Analyzing Public Sentiment of Certified Internship and Independent Study Program

This is my code for undergraduate thesis. Here's the abstract:

Certified Internship and Independent Study Program (MSIB) is one of the programs which initiated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology to support one of the Kampus Merdeka curriculum policies that give opportunities for students to learn and develop themselves through activities outside class for three semesters. After almost two years, the MSIB program has received opinions from the public, whether it contains negative, positive, or neutral sentiments. This research aims to analyze public sentiment towards the MSIB program using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Support Vector Machine is a machine learning model that can work well on high-dimensional data, such as text data. The result shows that the average F1 score given by the Support Vector Machine when passed the 5-Fold Cross Validation process is 68,2%. The performance of the Support Vector Machine in classifying new data is categorized as tolerable, which produced an F1 Score of 74,12%, when using SVM to classify sentiments on data test. The overall results of sentiment classification using the Support Vector Machine show that neutral sentiment dominates public opinion about the MSIB program (74,39%), while negative sentiment becomes the second class of sentiment with the highest frequency (13,60%). Positive sentiment is the class sentiment that appears the least in public opinions about the MSIB program (12%). Neutral sentiment dominates public opinion toward the MSIB program because a large amount of opinion data contains interrogative sentences or news about the MSIB program itself
